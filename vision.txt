I want an app that can
1. Focus for the week
2. What you plan to work on tomorrow
3. Todo list with indefinite

I want it to leverage motivation to make discipline easier

The idea is to have it run in the bottom right box as a todo list and motivator. 
I want it to be easy to use, easy to run, and motivating and encouraging

I will create an alias for it

The structure for the app is
1 module for the
- weekly focus
- what you want to work on the next day so you don't have to think about it in 
the morning
- Todo list

The weekly focus will be 1 thing to focus on from a given subject
The subject could be something like communication
so I would make a file in ./subjects called communication
that would have a newline seperated list of things I want to focus on, with a 
number of the top representing the current line we are working on
Each week it will put the next item on the list
I will make it repeat by default, but maybe add options for each subject later
I could also do one of these for each month, so ill develop it to account for
that

What you plan to work on will just be a space in the app where you can look at
yesterdays notes and write new ones for yourself tomorrow

Basic todo list
using a file storage system
when an item is completed, it will be moved into the completed section
you will be able to delete all completed tasks
the completed section will be identified by the # being the only character in the
line

I will store the structure of the text files in memory first, and then when I
write it to a file, it should be easy to go back and forth

I will have a module to search files in a directory and return them in memory
This will be used for all of the 3 things
